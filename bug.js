This error occurs when using the `useEffect` hook in React Native with a function that returns a value.  The problem arises because the return value of a `useEffect` hook's callback is ignored.  In the example below, the `fetchUserData` function returns a promise that resolves with the user data.  However, this return value is not handled, leading to no visible error in the console but unexpected behavior in the app, possibly resulting in the component failing to update with fetched data. 

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  const fetchUserData = async () => {
    const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/user');
    const data = await response.json();
    setUserData(data);
    return data; // This return value is ignored
  };
  fetchUserData();
}, []);
```
